The laws are a distillation of 3,000 years in the history of power, drawing on the lives of strategists and historical figures like Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, Haile Selassie I, Carl von Clausewitz, Queen Elizabeth I, Henry Kissinger, and P.T. Barnum. Each law has its own chapter, complete with a <i>transgression of the law</i>, <i>observance of the law</i> and a <i>reversal</i>. <i>The 48 Laws of Power</i> has sold more than 1.2 million copies.</li><br>
            <li>Greene's second book, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Seduction-Robert-Greene/dp/1861977697/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=TCCS97CYC1S2QFYPE1NM" target="_blank"><b>The Art of Seduction</b></a>, was published in 2001 and is a handbook on the most subtle and effective form of power, seduction. The book profiles nine types of seducers and details aspects of attraction, authenticity, storytelling and negotiation.

Kennedy to support the psychology behind seduction. <i>The Art of Seduction</i> is mentioned in Neil Strauss' book <i>The Game</i> as a recommended book in the seduction community. It has sold more than 500,000 copies.</li><br>
            <li><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Strategies-War-Robert-Greene-Collection/dp/1861979789/ref=pd_sim_14_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=TCCS97CYC1S2QFYPE1NM" target="_blank"><b>The 33 Strategies of War</b></a> is the third book by Greene and was published in 2007.
